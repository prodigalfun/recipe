            <h1><h3>Background</h3></h1>
            <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The Pineapple Pie is a staple cuisine. Ideal for family gatherings, events or a personal desert for anyone who appreciates<br>
            the pineapple fruit for the masterpiece it is. Seriously, give this recipe a whirl. It's quite beginner friendly, not to mention very<br>
            nourishing. The pineapple toppings helps offset the unhealthiness of the common pie, which are often caked in sugar and little else.<br>
            This, however, is a refreshing change of pace. </p>
            <h1><h3>Ingredients </h3></h1>
