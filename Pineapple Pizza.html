<h1><h3>Background</h3></h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Pineapple pizza is widely hated, but I'm here to tell you the hate is unjustified. Why? Because pineapple pizza is frankly<br> to
    put it simply, awesome. And this recipe is here to prove it to you. Simple, elegant, and cultured, this recipe has it all. It's<br>
    filling, wonderful and a joy to consume. It's definitely more time consuming than the other recipes on this site, but<br> well worth it
    in the end.

    .Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br><br>
    
    .Make the cookie crust: Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. <br><br>
    Cream together butter and 3/4 cup sugar until smooth in a large bowl. Add in egg and beat well. <br><br
    Stir dry ingredients into the creamed mixture until just blended. Press dough into an ungreased pizza pan.<br>
    
   Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool.<br><br>
    
   Prepare the filling: Beat cream cheese with remaining 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy.<br>
    Spread evenly over the top of the cooled crust.<br><br>
    
    .Arrange blueberries, strawberries, and banana on top of the filling, and chill.</p>
