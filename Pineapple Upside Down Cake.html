    <h1> Additional Tips</h1>
    <p style="color:rgb(31, 180, 24);">
        "Vintage desserts are the best desserts," according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). <br>
        So it's no surprise that she loves this fruity, moist, and perfectly sweet cake. Here are a few of her favorite tips for<br>
         making the best pineapple upside-down cake of your life:<br><br>
    
        1: For extra flavor, use a mixture of the canned pineapple juice and water (instead of just water) in your cake mix.<br><br>
        2: Don't let the cake cool completely in the skillet, as this could cause sticking. Nicole likes to let it sit for<br>
         about 10 minutes â€“ then she releases it from the pan while it's still warm. She also loosens the side with an offset <br>
         spatula before turning the cake out.<br><br>
    
        3: This gorgeous cake is perfect for serving as-is. However, Nicole likes to finish each slice off with a dollop <br>
        of homemade whipped cream and another cherry.</p>
